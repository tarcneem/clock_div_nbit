Verilog-based clock divider and counter with testbench: parameterizable n-bit clock divider design, including a counter and testbench.
# Clock Divider (clock_div_nbit) Design and Testbench 
 Description This project includes a parameterizable clock divider and its corresponding testbench in Verilog. The clock divider generates a clock signal that is half the frequency of the input clock. Additionally, it includes a counter module to count the number of clock cycles. 
 Design The project comprises two main modules: 
 1. **Clock Divider Module (`clock_div_nbit`)**
 2.  **Counter Module (`counter_nbit`)**
